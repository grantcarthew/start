# Documentation Writing Guide

Guidelines for writing user-facing documentation.

Location: `docs/`

Read when: Creating or updating user documentation.

---

## Document Types

| Type | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| CLI reference | `docs/cli/*.md` | Command documentation |
| Configuration | `docs/configuration.md` | Config schema and options |
| Guides | `docs/guides/*.md` | Step-by-step tutorials |
| README | `README.md` | Project overview, quick start |
| Changelog | `CHANGELOG.md` | Version history |

For CLI command documentation, see `docs/cli/cli-writing-guide.md`.

## Audience

User documentation is written for humans, not AI agents. This differs from Design Records which are optimised for AI consumption.

| Aspect | User Docs | Design Records |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Audience | Humans | AI agents |
| Bold text | Use for emphasis | Avoid (wastes tokens) |
| Tone | Conversational | Technical, concise |
| Structure | Task-oriented | Problem/Decision/Why |

---

## Writing Style

### Tone

Write in a conversational, friendly tone. Be direct but not robotic.

Good:
> Run this to generate your bash completion script. Restart your shell and you're good to go.

Avoid:
> Execute the following command to generate the bash completion script. Subsequently, restart your shell session.

### Voice

Use active voice and imperative mood for instructions.

Good:
> Run `start completion bash` to generate the script.

Avoid:
> The script can be generated by running `start completion bash`.

### Brevity

Keep it short. Users want to get things done, not read essays.

- One idea per paragraph
- Short sentences
- Use lists and tables over prose

---

## Formatting

### Headers

Use sentence case for headers (capitalise first word only).

Good: `## Shell completion`
Avoid: `## Shell Completion`

### Code Blocks

Use fenced code blocks with language hints:

````markdown
```bash
start completion bash > ~/.bash_completion.d/start
```
````

For command output, use plain code blocks:

````markdown
```
agent: claude
model: sonnet
```
````

### Bold and Emphasis

Use **bold** for UI elements, command names in prose, and important warnings.

Use _italics_ sparingly, mainly for introducing new terms.

### Links

Use relative links for internal docs:

```markdown
See [CLI writing guide](cli/cli-writing-guide.md) for details.
```

---

## Code Examples

### Make Them Runnable

Examples should work when copy-pasted. Include all necessary context.

Good:

```bash
# Generate and install bash completion
start completion bash > ~/.bash_completion.d/start
source ~/.bashrc
```

Avoid:

```bash
start completion bash > <output-file>
```

### Show Expected Output

When helpful, show what the user should see:

```bash
$ start --version
start v0.1.0
```

### Use Real Values

Use realistic values, not placeholders like `<your-value>`.

Good: `start --agent claude`
Avoid: `start --agent <agent-name>`

---

## File Naming

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `shell-completion.md`
- Be descriptive but concise
- Match command names where applicable: `completion.md` for the completion command
